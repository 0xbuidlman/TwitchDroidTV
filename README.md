This was a project I worked on for Cal Hacks 2014 because I wanted to watch Twitch on my Android TV without having to Chromecast it from my laptop.

Current list of features:
-------------------------
* Watching streams (lol)
* Browsing featured streams and top games
* Browsing streams for a specific game
* Searching for games and streams

Features to be added:
---------------------------
* Providing content recommendations to the Android TV recommendation system
* Logging in and browsing followed streams
* Searching for and watching past broadcasts
